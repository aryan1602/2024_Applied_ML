2773,"Subject: sddp model  john ,  attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the  developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor  of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :  www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls  are possible .  development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs  on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .  while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around  1994 .  the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,  so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m  not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .  most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission  constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices .  a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .  if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

3144,"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time  period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save  it .  if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,  family  time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes  have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies .  if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time  or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .  there is no code for non - exempt overtime .  this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to  fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will  try and remind you by email the day before .  i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any  other  off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you .  if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .  thanks !  shirley",0

1343,"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

"" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks , "" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw . "" but eventually they have to generate some  return . ""  enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it  entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool ' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  "" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . ""  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry ' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .  "" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  "" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . ""  in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  "" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really  know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland ' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  "" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  "" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture  gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

3401,"Subject: news article on enron  india : enron aftermath  business line - 02 / 21 / 2000  abhay mehta  copyright ( c ) 2000 kasturi source : world reporter ( tm ) -  asia intelligence wire  power play  a study of the enron project  * publishers : orient longman , new delhi * price : rs . 195  the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has  been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the  inception of the project proposal in 1992 ; and the sordid tale ends only  in 1997 , with the supreme court of india refusing to even  admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision , of december 1996 ,  which while commenting that "" this case has  highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence ,  political considerations outweigh the public interest and  the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to  justify its actions not only before the public but even before  the courts of law "" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the  project on the ( purely technical ) ground of res judicata , even  though new facts , new arguments , new evidence of the violation of the laws  of the land had been advanced by the petitioners .  the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and  recorded , despite the petitioners adducing the required  evidence , can only be termed as strange , perhaps bizarre .  abhay mehta ' s simple , factual documentation - in fact a chronological  narration - of all events , including the process of bending all  rules , of subverting the law for promoting a project involving  unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra , indeed for the whole of  india - is not only masterly , it is devastating .  it is a short , pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by  all thinking citizens of this country . barring the  concluding chapter , the epilogue , there are no personal comments , only  facts , disseminated from the original papers , mostly ' secret '  documents .  all documentation has been carefully , faithfully recorded , including  extracts from supposedly ' top secret ' minutes of cabinet  committee meetings ; and the specific violations of the law ( which were  opposed by a few public spirited civil servants , much to  their disadvantage ) have been pointed up . apart from an introductory  ' primer on electricity ' - introduced for the benefit of the  layman , explaining some technical issues relating to electricity  generation , transmission and distribution - and the background of the  events of 1991 , the foreign exchange crisis , and the aftermath of the  crisis , the other fifteen chapters , three appendices and fourteen  annexes of the small book ( of 226 pages ) packs in an enormous volume of  factual information . the strange saga of the enron  project , and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single  project poses for the country , need to be briefly recounted  here , for essentially , it is the coming generation which would have to  face the problem .  the mseb has contracted to buy - and if not used , to pay for - 2000 mw of  electricity ( for a period of 20 years ) from the  dabhol power company ( the legal entity set up by enron , as an unlimited  liability company registered in india , through a maze of  intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more ' front '  companies registered in various tax - free havens .  abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount  to $ 35 billion ( at 1998 exchange rates , around rs .  1 , 25 , 000 crores ) over the life of the project . one must record that : ( a )  crude oil / oil product prices have as of writing , more than  doubled since the above calculations were made . a per the ' doctored '  figures presented by the company ( and its advocate ) , the  charge per unit of electricity supplied , at the 1998 level of prices , was  to 4 . 39 cent ( per unit ) as ' capacity charge ' and 3 . 43 cents  ( per unit ) for ' energy costs ' .  the former is indexed to the us inflation rate , and the latter to  international fuel prices . the former may be assumed to have gone  up only marginally ( rounded to 4 . 4 cents per unit ) ; we know that fuel  prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 .  assuming the ' fuel costs ' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even  though international prices have more than doubled - we  may assume ( for 1999 ) energy costs of 6 . 85 cents per units , making for a  total payment of 11 . 25 us cents per unit of electricity  supplied by the dabhol power company ( dpc ) to mseb in late 1999 , in phase  i of the project .  within another two years , at 2000 mw , the annual offtake ( for 365 days x  24 hours / day ) would be 17 . 52 billion kwh ; and at  11 . 25 cents per unit , the total payment amounts to $ 1 . 97 billion annually ;  for 20 years , this workout to $ 39 . 4 billion .  this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or  capacity charge . at today ' s exchange rate - about rs . 43 . 5 per us  dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs . 175 , 000 crores ( as  compared to rs . 125 , 000 crores indicated by abhay  mehta ) . this is the cost to mseb in rupee ; and to the country in foreign  exchange as payment to just one project authority , for  supply of part of the power required in maharashtra .  the really significant point to note in this connection is that this  payment - and considerably more , depending on ( a ) future increase  in ' capacity charges ' depending on us inflation rate , and international  prices of lngaphtha ( for ' fuel costs ' ) , and ( b ) depreciation of  the exchange rate of the rupee vis - a - vis the us dollar - is obligatory ;  the assets of the mseb , the maharashtra government  indeed , all assets of the government of india ( present and future ) are  mortgaged to enron , by way of sovereign guarantees  extended by both governments .  the other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by  all independent indian experts as well as the world bank - the  enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric  company ' s and its own much cheaper thermal power  already ; in a postscript dated august 1999 , abhay mehta has indicated that  already , the mseb had stopped buying between 200  and 250 mw of power from tata electric ( available at rs . 1 . 80 per unit )  and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal  power station ( cost of this power being rs . 1 . 20 per unit ) , while forced  to buy more expensive enron power at rs . 5 per unit .  the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs . 460 crore per year .  this had in fact , been predicted earlier even by the world bank .  it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was  contrived , by a deliberate campaign of ' disinformation ' , of  blatant lies , of sidelining of expert opinion , not only of independent  experts but also the goi ' s own official advisers in this matter ,  namely , the central electricity authority as well as that of the world  bank , which was resolutely opposed to this project . the  detailed facts , the letters exchanged in the above context , the pressure  tactics adopted , the flouting of all procedures norms , even  statutory provisions of the electricity ( supply ) act , are all carefully  documented by abhay mehta .  mehta correctly concludes : "" we frequently blame external agencies - like  the world bank - for all our problems , when , as a  matter of fact , we ourselves are our own worst enemies . in the instant  case , the world bank not only advised the government of  india against the project , it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of  the total inadvisability of this project . in fact , one must note  here that in 1996 , neighbouring pakistan , which had entered into a  somewhat similar mou with enron , cancelled the project ( and  the power purchase agreement with enron ) , for a $ 670 million , 782 mw  residual oil - fuelled power plant , even though that  agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 . 4 us  cents per kwh over a 30 year period . ( note the  estimated rate of 11 . 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in  december 1999 , which works out to around rs . 5  per unit ) .  one could go on ; but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta ' s  crisp , factual , matter of fact narration of the enron  saga , and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the  story , about ' the next round of scams ' .  for quite some time , the ruling elite in india has been intent on  ' privatising ' all public enterprises ; and even ' utilities ' are no  exception . the ' unbundling ' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation  of all the ' profitable ' segments . all this - as per the current  ' disinformation campaign ' - is supposedly in the interest of  rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply .  the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the  government - by the torrent group - of the ahmedabad and  surat electricity companies at less than one - tenth of the market value of  the assets of thee facilities . again , much like the enron  saga , all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government  were overruled .  and , abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break - up of  power utilities into three segments , generation , transmission  and distribution , - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the  new thrust by the ruling elite , for reasons that do not require to  be spelt out .  though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad  and surat electricity companies , and of the break  up of the orissa state electricity board before him , yet his statement can  be stated today to be prophetic ; the upseb is now on  the firing line . the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the  upseb in protest of the announced up government decision  to trifurcate the upseb ; and the union minister of power , mr . rangarajan  kumaramangalam ' s statement that the upseb is a  loss making , inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities  after the trifurcation - need to be noted .  that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government ; that  tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up  government and not by the upseb ; that the upseb does not have the cash  even for routine maintenance as a result of the above  - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider . that the  remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and  restructuring , is not even to be debated . the whole idea is to privatise  the profitable segments , and to leave the public sector entity  with all the problem areas , including rural energy supply . it is against  this background that abhay mehta ' s book needs to be widely  disseminated , read , and its implications understood .  what is at stake is not a ' utility ' here or a psu there . what is at stake  is the future of some 80 per cent of the have - nots in this  country .  what is at stake is the ' pillory ' of the assets of the nation for private  aggrandisement .  arun ghosh",0

operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .",1

5128,"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant",0

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

4009,"Subject: re : ebs var transaction policy  i have two things biting me .  first is time . i need to turn a draft for hannon and rice asap . so , the  value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a v @ r policy will quickly  evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say .  second , i have a unique situation . our concept of v @ r is really unlike the  rest of enron ' s today . what happens today is that network engineers  unilaterally make decisions about deployment , configuration and other matters  which effect the longs and shorts of our asset / contract portfolio that they  view strictly from a network operating standpoint .  a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop ( three large  servers storing 165 gigabytes each ) from portland to la . the servers are  already in place and purchased , so no capital was involved . but the  decision has huge ramifications on the future la / new york and other bandwidth  usage , and that cost money . now it could be that the la / new york cost is  cheaper than the portland / new york cost , the whole point is no one knows .  what our "" value - at - risk "" policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions  and put them into the hands of the risk management group , where the decision  will be made with at least some economic work behind it .  i really see the ebs v @ r policy to be misnamed , since we don ' t really have  the math done to calc v @ r . it really is a volumetric - based control policy  that says you can ' t make network changes over xx amount of megabytes ( a  storage measure ) or oc - 3 equivalents ( a bandwidth measure ) without risk  management making or approving the decision . i do believe that with  research ' s help , we can in time actually calculate the v @ r impact of such  decisions . at that time , the policy should be modified to set metrics based  on the v @ r calculations .  so if you have an open enough mind to let us co - op your word for a minute ,  we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into  thinking about their decisions as having value effects . said directly ,  kevin hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over  significant network changes from the field to the trading floor , and i am  going to issue something now to effectuate that . . . . . .  so . . . i really want your views on what we are doing , but thought you needed  some flavor and an sense of the urgency . if you can weigh in , do so  quickly . . . . .  barry pearce  06 / 30 / 00 04 : 47 am  to : john echols / enron communications @ enron communications , lou casari / enron  communications @ enron communications  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  positive . . . .  - - - - - forwarded by barry pearce / enron communications on 06 / 30 / 00 04 : 49 am  - - - - -  ted murphy @ ect  06 / 29 / 00 11 : 33 am  to : barry pearce / enron communications @ enron communications @ enron  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  barry ,  conceptually , i see no reason that a process like this can not be  implemented . in some way we have attempted to do so through the enron corp  transaction approval process ( tap ) . i have forwarded to john a copy of this ,  along with the risk management policy . i ' ll let him share with you if ok ( i  really don ' t want to act as the firm ' s in - house kinko ' s !

 i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail  the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples  from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0

4269,"Subject: hurricane warning derivatives  folks ,  this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress  toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line  of products .  it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane  warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative  products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this  exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural  counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure :  pro - hurricane anti - hurricane  the weather channel resorts  home depot cruise ships  lowes riverboat casinos  cnn chemical plants and refineries  local tv stations u . s armed forces  dry ice manufacturers athletic teams  chainsaw manufacturers city governments  insect repellant manufacturers state governments  it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is  important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature  while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have  documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the  thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional  products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in  bundled regional products depending on their exposure .  thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data  from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by  year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning  duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary  data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s  coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly  similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north  carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida  panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas .  while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it  has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration  is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility ,  when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to  effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning  frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be  well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly  probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves .  as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be  scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends ,  satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go  further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline .  on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the  weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given  our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the  easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when  we should approach customers .  please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project .  thanks ,  charlie",0

5199,Subject: ethylene margin collar model  dear all :  let us meet early this afternoon .  here is the overview of the model :  1 ) the ethylene margin collars are priced using asian spread option .  the forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk .  the correlation between the ethylene and ethylene cost starts from the  historical spot correlation 50 % and grows with the maturity .  2 ) the overall 40 mm payout cap is modeled sepereately .  i fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model  with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side . the model  produces  trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data .  then the expected payoff is computed through simulation .  at the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results .  zimin,0

3538,"Subject: enron net works  it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .  enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we  have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over  $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .  we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very  specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .",0

1207,"Subject: business partnership ( urgent / confidential )  mr . vincent nnaji ,  standard trust bank ltd ,  lagos , nigeria .  dear sir ,  i am mr . vincent nnaji , bank manager of standard trust bank , lagos , nigeria . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you .  on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant foreign contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation mr . james herbert made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) in my branch .  upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident .  on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 20 m has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe - keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it .  according to nigerian law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money i deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as i tagged them to be photographic materials for export i am writing you because i as a public servant i cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $ 1 m .  i want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney . all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials .  this is simple . i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes . the money will be shared in the ratio of 70 % for me and 25 % for you and 5 % will take care of all expenses .  there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via my private email address .  upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .  awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest .  thanks and regards ,  mr . vincent nnaji .",1

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company",0

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  ( see attached file : license . doc )",0

"" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added .",0

2156,"Subject: re : efa meetings  hey vince ,  thanks for your reply . i ' ll see what becomes of the session and keep you  informed . as to the paper , tim crack and i have a revised version of the  paper i gave you . we have since found out that by using certainty  equivalence , our model is more robust . for example , if one has an asset  pricing model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( harvey and  siddique , jf june , 2000 ) and a binomial model that incorporates mean ,  variance , and skewness ( johnson , paulukiewicz , and mehta , rqfa , 1997 ) , our  model allows you to price options under the real world measure . the  benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical  data that is non - risk neutralized .  from a pricing perspective , there isn ' t a tremendous benefit in a  mean - variance world ( variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky  measure ) . however , in the mean - variance - skewness world , there is a benefit  because we do not believe ( although we ' re still hunting down an appropriate  cite ) skewness is the same under risk - neutral and risky measure . given we  can only measure the skewness in our risky world , our model becomes much  more significant .  i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you  have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like  to see it .  thanks again ,  tom",0

2929,"Subject: access on the block : international transmission auctions - cera a  lert - december 20 , 2000  title : access on the block : international transmission auctions are opening  european power markets  e - mail category : cera insight  cera knowledge area : european power  despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission  system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence ,  auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united  kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the  netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single european marketplace .  however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming ,  third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand ,  these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme .  nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe ' s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 .  international auctions are opening markets  a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera ' s view auctions for  itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas :  * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market ' s  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time ,  signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market .  * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ?  * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based  allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic  character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points .  * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given  price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in  greater competition at the national level .  * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import .  * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links . access to international  transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for  details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets .  connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators .  even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera ' s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions :  * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission ' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach .  * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a  specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission ' s stated  preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching .  * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power .  * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation .  * * end * *  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 ! ?
